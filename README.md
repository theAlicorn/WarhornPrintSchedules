#WarhornPrintSchedules
This simple application will take a JSON schedule for an event from the Warhorn site and format the data for printing using your brower's print feature.

#Basic usage:

* Download the zip file.
* There is an html file called start.html
* open this in a modern browser (Tested in Chrome on Windows 7)
* Select the JSON file from the Warhorn site for the events that you wish to print paper schedules
* Depending on how big your file is and the speed of your computer this may take a minute to run.
* You should now see a series of tables with the Scenario name, levels, GMs, players, etc.
* Each table will print on its own sheet of paper.  Just use the browser's print button.
